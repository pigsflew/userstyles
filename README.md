this is mostly a personal collection of userstyles that I have mucked around with, used, and may someday distribute.

I make no guarantees that they work.

Everything I write or modify is rereleased under CC-BY-SA.

== Thanks & Attributions ==

This repository started with some userscript styles I modified from that were originally written by other folks on userstyles.org.
